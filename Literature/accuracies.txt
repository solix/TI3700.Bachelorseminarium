Five issues have to be faced (Kubat et al., 1998) while dealing with oil spill detection problem in machine learning domain: the way examples are presented, imbalance of the dataset's class distribution, validity of the data selection, feature engineering problem and highly dynamic environment.

Oil Spill Detection by SAR Images: Dark Formation Detection, Feature Extraction and Classification Algorithms
Neural network classifiers are not very popular as they are rather complex and they require specific knowledge on the theory of neural systems. Their complexity relates with decisions on network family, network architecture, on the way the data are introduced during the training and the point where the training should stop. They considered reliable classifiers since they have the ability to learn during training.
