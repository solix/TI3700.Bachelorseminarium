In Mera, Cotos, Varela-Pet, Rodriguez & Caro (2014) a Decision Support System to detect oil spills has been created. For classification both a neural network and a decision tree are used. Since both classifiers are designed and tested using the same data, a comparison on accuracy can be made. The neural network appears to outperform the decision tree slightly.
