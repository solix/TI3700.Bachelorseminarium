\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Comparison between MLP and SVM is done using same dataset. MLP accuracy in classifying the ECG(Electrocardiography) signals, is more accurate than other ANN. MLP with back propogation(BP) training algorithm suffer from slow convergance to local minima, on the other hand SVM classifier with (K-A) training do not trap in local minima points therefore they are faster than ANN. \cite{Moavenian20103088}
	\item  In high dimensional data, SVM accomplishes better accuracy compare to MLP, this is when new kernel function proposed for SVM. The reason behind is that MLP needs more hidden units for tested data set and become more complex when the dimension of data set increases whereas SVM complexity does not depend on dimension of data set. SVM are efficient on optimal separation of unseen data points.\cite{Zanaty2012177}
	\item SVM works better than MLP for the off-line signature recognition(within finite database), The comparison is done between the identification rate(increment of 20\% for SVM) and for training time needed. The superiority of SVM is because of its generalization ability in high dimensional space\cite{FriasMartinez2006693}.

	\item SVM outperforms to MLP, in Wind speed prediction. The comparison is done using a wind speed dataset that cover a 12 years between 1970-1982. Dataset is divided into three parts: training, test and validation sets. The output result shown the SVM outperform MLP on all orders resulting in the lower MSE(MLP is 0.0090 while it is 0.0078)\cite{Mohandes2004939}.
