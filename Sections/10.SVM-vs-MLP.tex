SVM classifiers are less known as MLP in the remote sensing community. That makes it difficult to make a comparison between the two. Due to the popularity of MLP in oil spill detection, there are very few researches known who try to compare SVMs' accuracy with MLPs' in detecting oil spills.\\ 

According to one of the studies done in classifying Oil Fluorescence Spectra, a comparison between support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) is performed \cite{almhdi2007classification}. There they try to examine these two classifiers to examine crude oils, heavy refined oil, and sludge oils; The result shows that both ANNs and SVMs prove to be reliable and fast. The SVM was preferred because the SVM method has proven to be more stable than ANN.\\

Another study shows SVM and MLP doing about equally bad in a comparison study with seven classifiers \cite{Xu201414}. Both did significantly worse than other classifiers. SVM slightly outperformed MLP, especially after preprocessing was done. 

On the other hand, using MLP in remote sensing is widely suggested by researchers\cite{Mera201472,Brekke200595,fingas2014review}. Various architectures have been used and tested and the scientific community seems to trust MLP capabilities. One of the reasons behind choosing MLP over an SVM classifier is that data sets are imbalanced and scarce. Most instances belong to a larger class (look alikes) and very few instances of a smaller class (oil spills). Lack of instances in a minority class will cause SVM to suffer from biased decision boundary and prediction performance. But there are techniques to make SVM more viable in these situations. For example, combining SVM with an over-sampling and under-sampling technique can boost SVM performance \cite{liu2006boosting}.

MLP and SVM seem to be classifiers that are proper rivals. Theoretically, they both handle complex data well. Empirically they both show decent accuracy in different circumstances. These circumstances are hard to derive however, as not every study shows their exact design decisions. SVM is a younger technique, and this is reflected in the strong preference for MLP over SVM in the oil spill detection community.
