SVM and MLP are two popular classifiers that have lots of potential to truthfully predict classification solutions in various classifications problems\cite{Moavenian20103088,Zanaty2012177}. If a comparison is done theoretically then SVM and MLP have their own distinguishing advantages. SVM classifiers have a strong foundational theory and need less memory to store the predictive model; Even when the training sample has some bias, If the right parameters are chosen for SVM, then it can be robust\cite{auria2008support} but the advantages of MLP are not as few as SVM. MLPs are popular in machine learning solutions such as speech recognition, image recognition because of their ability to solve problems stochastically, meaning that it allows user to get an approximate solution for very complex problems like fitness approximation\cite{jin2005neural}. Here we will look closely at SVM and MLP performance using real world dataset in remote sensing.\\

SVM classifiers are less known as MLP in the remote sensing community, That makes it difficult to make a direct comparison between the two. However SVM's accuracy in detecting oil spills can be as good as MLP. A study has shown that the performance of SVM is exceeding if using the right kernel algorithm inside SVM \cite{liu2006boosting}. On the other hand using MLP in remote sensing is widely suggested by researchers\cite{Mera201472,Brekke200595,fingas2014review}. According to their studies done In oil spill detection using SAR images, =MLP classifiers with various design architects is proposed. One of the reasons behind choosing MLP over an SVM classifier is because the data sets are imbalanced and scarce, in which most instances belong to a larger class (look alikes) and very few instances of a smaller class (oil spills). Lack of instances in minority class will cause SVM suffer from biased decision boundary and prediction performance. A solution is proposed for solving this problem. Combining SVM with an over-sampling and under-sampling technique will make SVM outperform other classifiers\cite{liu2006boosting}.


Another attempt has been made to compare different classifiers for oil spill detection.\cite{Xu201414} Here they experienced an opposite result. Out of seven classifiers, the MLP was found to perform the worst by $14.8$ percentage points. The results indicated that the additional flexibility provided by SVM and MLP does not necessarily improve the predictive performance compared to less flexible methods. Both tend to over fit the data set in small-sized training samples and could not generalize well.
