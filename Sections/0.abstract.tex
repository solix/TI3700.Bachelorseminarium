Marine oil spills cause big problems, financially and ecologically. To prevent and react accordingly to oil spills, detection is required. This detection process is not easy since succesful discrimination of oil spills and look alikes(e.g. algea, grease ice, rain cells and low wind areas) is dependent on the classification techniques used. This is why different classifiers are studied to support the decisions of experts in a automatic detection system. In this paper we look specifically at the classification of oil spills in Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR) images. We compare three commonly used classifiers: Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees and MultiLayer Perceptrons based on their accuracy and overall characteristics in order to give a recommendation. A wide range of papers using the different classifiers is discussed and their performance summarized in \ref{fig:table}. When looking at the table, it is hard and inappropriate to directly compare classifiers in terms of accuracy since they all use a different dataset and set of features. MLP is often used in oil spill detection and increasingly in the more broad remote sensing as well. MLP and SVM are well suited when the dataset is large, because of their ability to handle non-liniear data, but they are prone to over fitting. The easier understandable decision tree should be considered when data is scarce.
