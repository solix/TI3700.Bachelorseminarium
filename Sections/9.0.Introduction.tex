In this section, We will investigate comparisons between three classifiers SVM, DT and MLP, in different areas of study, to measure their performance and accuracy in their prediction.\\
In order to have an indicator on suitable classifier in certain discipline, user needs to tune some concrete parameter such as dimensionality of feature, size of dataset and dataset balance to be able to  decide on performance ratio, mean squared error(MSE) , accuracy or recognition rate of output; for example SVMs and MLP outperform to DT, when dealing with high dimensional feature whereas for classification problems that deals with discrete features, DT is preferred.\cite{kotsiantis2007supervised}.
