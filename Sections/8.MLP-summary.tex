\hspace{0.5cm} MultiLayer Perceptrons are a type of supervised learning \cite{michie1994machine}. It is a type of neural network consisting of multiple layers of perceptrons. A perceptron is a system of nodes with input nodes, called the input layer, and an output node called the output layer. Inputs from a vector $x$ are fed to the input layer with weights $w$. Within the perceptron, each input value is compared with a certain function and increased by a certain weight. The output is determined based on the threshold
