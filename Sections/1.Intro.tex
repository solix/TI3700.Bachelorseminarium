Marine oil Spill is a form of human made environmental pollution usually occur during transportation of oil, drilling platforms or tankers \cite{Zhang201476}or during the maintenance on oil exploration sites in the ocean. One of the most destructible damages caused by oil spills in the history happened in the Gulf of Mexico as the oil spread out in the ocean by the explosion on the drilling platform affected marine ecosystem and wild life\cite{Bozeman2011244}.\\
Detection of oil spills can help to control environmental risks and prevent incalculable damages by it. Synthetic aperture radar(RAS) image is useful to detect oil spills spots in the ocean. SAR image has a high resolution, wide area coverage and moreover image can be taken day and night under any weather conditions. This enables oil spill investigators to monitor ocean 24 hours a day\cite{Chang20081915}.\\
There are various automated systems proposed in order to detect spills spots in SAR images. These systems analyzes the SAR images, assigns the probability of dark spots and proposes an algorithm to classify the dark images in to the oil spills and look alike shapes \cite{Xu201414,brekke2008classifiers,Keramitsoglou2006640,Guo2014146}.\\
In machine learning classification of oil spills from lookalike in SAR images is of highest importance. Main purpose of this article is to  investigate three popular supervised learning classifiers in general. Later on more specific research is done on qualitative comparison between these classifiers in order to derive the criteria in choosing algorithm/s and classifier/s that would be most suitable for detection of oil spills in SAR images.
