\hspace{0.5cm} A decision tree is a classifier that makes several sequential decisions. The structure of a decision tree is defined as a set of nodes with edges between them. The edges are directed and there are no cycles in the network. The tree has one root. With each decision or classification to be made, we start at the root. The root node is fed information about certain features derived from the data set. Each node contains a rule that allows the node to make a decision. Each decision leads to a different node, where another decision is made. This process repeats itself until one of the leave nodes is reached. From there we can determine what class our initial data point belonged to \cite{safavian1991survey}.
