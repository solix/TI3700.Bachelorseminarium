\hspace{0.5cm} It is impossible to fully compare Support Vector Machines and Decision Trees. Both have advantages and disadvantages, each serving it's own purpose. One such difference is that DTs are faster when handling new dataset, compared to SVM. THis is because of the complexity of SVMs' arithmatic computations, where DTs only need to follow a logical path in a tree. A more interesting difference is that SVM has higher accuracy in general as was observed in numerous studies\cite{arun2010hybrid}.
