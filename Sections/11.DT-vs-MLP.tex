\begin{itemize}
	
	\item  In \cite{Mera2014} a Decision Support System to detect oil spills has been created. For classification both a neural network and a decision tree are used. Since both classifiers are designed and tested using the same data, a comparison on accuracy can be made. The neural network appears to outperform the decision tree slightly.\cite{Moavenian20103088}
	
	\item  Another study by \cite{Xu2014} also compared different classifers for oil spill detection. Here they experienced an opposite result. Out of seven classifiers, the ANN was found to perform the worst by 14.8 percentage points. The results indicated that the additional flexibility provided by SVM and ANN does not necessarily improve the predicitive performance compared to less flexible methods. Both tend to overfit the dataset on small-sized training samples and could not generalize well.
