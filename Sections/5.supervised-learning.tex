In machine learning algorithm, every instance in any dataset is represented using same set of features. If a given instances is associated with known labels then the learning is called `supervised'. If instance of the dataset is  then is called `unsupervised learning'.\cite{maglogiannis2007emerging}.\\

`supervised learning' is an important machine learning methodology that demands learning a mapping between a set of input variable and output variable . It prescribes the learning system on the labels to couple with training data; Supervised learning algorithm will infer models from these training data to classify unseen data and associate a label to the unlabeled data.\cite{cord2008machine}\\
