In machine learning algorithms, every instance in any dataset is represented using same set of features. Teaching a classification algorithms means that they are given a set of training data and they have to learn which data point belongs to which class. In supervised learning, the instances of the dataset are known to belong to a certain class. So once a training epoch is done, the machine can determine exactly how well he did by looking at the labels of each instance he classified. The alternative is unsupervised learning. In this case, the class of each instance is unknown and there is no reward when the classifier picks the right class. After all, the right class is unknown. This technique is therefore more often used when trying to discover hidden classes in new datasets \cite{maglogiannis2007emerging}.\\

Supervised learning is an important machine learning methodology that demands learning a mapping between a set of input variable and output variable. It prescribes the learning system on the labels to couple with training data; Supervised learning algorithm will infer models from these training data to classify unseen data and associate a label to the unlabeled data.\cite{cord2008machine}\\
